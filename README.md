## Requirements

Lucee 5.3.9.73 or above.

## Installation

You can install this extension into a preconfigured Lucee server via Commandbox:

```bash
box install D062D72F-F8A2-46F0-8CBC91325B2F067B
```

This will not work unless `box server start` has been run first to set up the Lucee engine directories. Use `--dryRun` to set up the Lucee server without actually starting the server process. This will prevent ORM from attempting to initialize before the extension is installed:

```bash
box
box> server start --dryRun
box> install D062D72F-F8A2-46F0-8CBC91325B2F067B
box> server start
```
